 abstract = {Multivariate statistical techniques are based upon the Hilbert space Structure of the set of random variables with finite variance, and are therefore generalizable to any set having such a structure. In Particular, since certain applications lead to families of vector random variables we are led to the problem of finding the Hilbert space which permits the above generalization to families of vector variables. The inner product which is used possesses theoretical and practical properties which are discussed. An illustrative example is given.},
